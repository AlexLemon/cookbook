# Vegetarian Paella
**Joe Baker**

I first tasted paella during a couple of holidays in Majorca before I turned vegetarian and immediately fell in love with the dish. Since turning vegetarian (about 15 years ago) I've learned a non-meat paella that is super-simple but utterly delicious. Paella, with no seafood, you say? I know! But this is utterly delicious. Try it and see!
