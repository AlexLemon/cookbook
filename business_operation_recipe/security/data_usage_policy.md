# Data usage policy

This policy supports our I.T. Security Policy. The purpose of this policy is to prevent unauthorised disclosure, modification, removal or destruction of information assets, and disruption to our business activities.

The document forms part of our alignment to the ISO 27001 Information Security Management System standard.

## Location

This policy is applicable to all staff and contractors using Convivio systems and those of its clients and suppliers. 

## Responsibility 

It is the responsibility of the CEO and COO to accept and implement this policy and to ensure that the security controls are implemented. All staff have a responsibility to comply with this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may affect our information services and could result in disciplinary action.

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to prevent unauthorised disclosure, modification, removal or destruction of our information assets, and disruption to any of our business activities.

Except when specifically authorised after a risk assessment of the necessary business case, corporate records/data shall not be stored on local computers, mobile devices including laptops, USB memory sticks, PDAâ€™s, external hard drives or any other mobile device or media such as smart phones, CD or DVD except for agreed backups.

In some cases storing sensitive information on a mobile device may be unavoidable for the completion of work duties and the provision of care. Such cases shall be subject to:

* appropriate technical risk assessment by the management;
* meet the security requirements of this policy; and agreed backup;

## Data Encryption Procedure

All sensitive data stored on local drives of laptops are covered by this procedure.

All removable media for use on information systems owned or operated by Convivio are covered by this procedure.

Removable media includes (but is not limited to):

* Tapes
* Floppy discs
* Removable or external hard disc drives
* Optical discs DVD and CD-rom
* Solid state memory devices including memory cards
* Pen drives

Currently approved cryptographic algorithms are for encryption - 3DES, AES (FIPS 140-2), and should be used at recommended 256bit strength. These algorithms and bit strength are readily available within a range of commercially available off the shelf security products and services.

The use of freeware or shareware that does not benefit from independent security evaluation or that fails to comply with these standards is not permitted and must be avoided.

## Security Procedures

The loss or theft of data that is being processed on a piece of removable media should be evaluated for its sensitivity and any potential impact that this would have due to this or any other compromise.

No real time data should be used for testing purposes, the use of annonymised information should be used outside of live environments. Unless specifically required by the client and the project, the use of anonymised data should be used for testing in staging and live environments.

All staff should be trained in the use of encryption tools or application facilities provided, and for the handling of encrypted removable media.

Where encrypted removable media is to be shared, care must be taken to ensure that the intended recipient has the correct technical capability to de-crypt the data on receipt and this should be established in advance of any sharing of media.

All pass-phrases or decryption keys used for encryption/decryption purposes must be sufficiently long and complex to prevent the encrypted information from attack. The decryption pass-phrase or key must never be sent with encrypted removable media.

Password managers such as LastPass or OnePass should be used to generate any personal passwords at least 8 characters in length containing alphanumeric and punctuation characters required for hardware and software and stored within the encrypted password facility.

In all cases where data encryption is used, a full auditable record should be maintained of the media and data involved and its intended purposes including dates of encrypted file creation, transmission and destruction.

Audit spot checks will be conducted by the organisation to ensure this policy is complied with. Any compliance issues will be reported to the line managers concerned and may be handled through staff disciplinary processes or contractual arrangements.

All incidents involving encrypted data must be reported to the Management immediately.

Personal Computers including Laptops, Tablet and Handheld Computers Whole Disk Encryption shall be applied. Laptop encryption Mac: default in Lion or later: FileVault 2 uses full disk, XTS-AES 128 encryption to help keep your data secure. Using FileVault 2, you can encrypt the contents of your entire drive.

## Phone encryption

### iPhone

Data protection is available for devices that offer hardware encryption, including iPhone 3GS and later, all iPad models, and iPod touch (3rd generation and later). Data protection enhances the built-in hardware encryption by protecting the hardware encryption keys with your passcode. This provides an additional layer of protection for your email messages attachments, and third-party applications.

### Samsung

Samsung offers Device Encryption and On Device Encryption solutions as well as FIPS 140-2 certification for your devices to make sure that your corporate security needs are properly addressed.

### Procurement of Encrypted Memory Sticks
Only approved encrypted USB memory sticks must be purchased.

### Encrypted jump drive options: Data Traveler 4000

The decryption pass-phrase or key must never be sent with encrypted removable media.

## Removable Media

Export of unencrypted identifiable information onto removable media such as CD, SD cards DVD or ZIP drives MUST be avoided unless for approved backup purposes and then they must be stored securely.

Any requests to do otherwise must be authorised as per the management.

## External Hard Drives

Users must show a business reason for the use of external hard drives and they must be of an approved type. They MUST be pre-encrypted and match the currently approved cryptographic algorithms.
