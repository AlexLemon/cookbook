# Holidays and Sickness

We all receive 25 days paid holiday each year in addition to the usual UK bank holidays. You'll need to keep a few days spare while we close the office between Christmas and New Year.

## Requesting Holiday

Simple. Get a peer review for your holiday by posting a request in the "general" channel in Slack. We need to make sure your holiday fits in with projects and holiday already booked by the rest of the Convivio team.

When your holiday has been booked it needs to be logged in:

* [Float](https://convivio.float.com/) - we'll plan projects around your holiday
* [Holiday and Sickness log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxl-NhfdMHMG55sDu9YzKh0npYBQucZEshxbko97Ko0/edit#gid=0) - we keep track of your allowance and remaining holiday here

We have a policy of not carrying forward holiday from one holiday period to the next so be sure to use up your allowance and rest well.

## Reporting Sickness

We all get sick from time to time. All we ask is that you let us know as soon as possible so that we can keep projects, people and clients informed. 

On the first day of sickness contact SteveH and your project lead (if you have one) to let them know you're going to rest up. If it's unplanned sickness then keep us informed so we know whether or not to expect you back in the next day or next week. If it's planned sickness (hospital appointment etc) then let us know your likely sickness dates as soon as possible so we can plan around them.

We log sick days in our [Holiday and Sickness log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxl-NhfdMHMG55sDu9YzKh0npYBQucZEshxbko97Ko0/edit#gid=0)
