# Discovery

A discovery is the first part of a delivery stream.

It allows us to collaborate with the client to explore the mission that has been set for the stream.

A discovery is not a one off thing. It's required to start a stream of work, but then key points of change or challenge may highlight the need for another discovery.

The process for discovery is:

1. Start with a [Discovery Briefing](/delivery_recipe/Discovery/the-discovery-brief.md)

2. Do [Discovery Planning](/delivery_recipe/Discovery/discovery-planning.md) to decide which modules are required and how to deliver them

3. Deliver the required [Discovery Modules](/delivery_recipe/Discovery/discovery-modules.md)
4. Present the Discovery Findings
5. Transition to a Prototyping phase to test the findings
