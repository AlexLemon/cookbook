# Sprint Planning

## About Sprint Planning

Every sprint begins with sprint planning. In this meeting we take the highest priority stories from the backlog, discuss them, estimate the effort required to complete them and place them in the sprint backlog. We continue this until the delivery team is happy that the sprint is full (and they mustn’t be pressured to accept more).

This meeting is about open communication. Regardless of the skills and experience of the individuals, all input is valuable. This is a team effort, no egos allowed.

The planning meeting is timeboxed to 8 hours. However, most of the time we’ll be managing projects with a distributed team, travelling to the client site for planning and we’ll need to fit the sprint review into the same day. Occasionally we need to flex our timeboxes so that we can do as much in person as possible.

## Who’s Involved

This is a mandatory meeting for the delivery team, the delivery manager and the product owner. Additionally certain subject matter experts from the client or 3rd parties may need to attend all or part of the meeting.
