# Delivery Recipe

This is the way we take client needs, investigate them, and work through all the stages of a delivery cycle.

We follow the process of:

1. [Strategy](/delivery_recipe/Strategy/README.md): Working to develop the overall digital strategy for an organisation, and identify missions for streams of work

2. [Discovery](/delivery_recipe/Discovery/README.md): Researching a mission and preparing for delivery
3. [Prototyping](/delivery_recipe/Prototyping/README.md): Experimenting with complex, risky, novel or unknown parts of the planned delivery in a rapid and low-cost way to reduce the risks and improve knowledge and approaches before beginning the main delivery.
4. Delivery: Design, build, test, deploy to deliver a solution to address the mission
5. Management: Supporting, reviewing and improving the live digital service
6. Retirement: Handing over control of the digital service, or eventually closing it down at the end of its life

To deliver this process we use agile methodologies:
* [Scrum](/delivery_recipe/scrum.md): For initial development, or for set project work

* [Kanban](/delivery_recipe/kanban.md): for continuous development, or support of live systems.
