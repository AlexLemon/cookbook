# Learning and Thinking

So far we've been nurturing a relationship with a contact, and now they've brought us an opportunity to work together. That means it's time for some learning and thinking to answer these key questions:

1. Do we understand what the client needs?

2. Can we provide it better than most other agencies?

3. Should we pursue this opportunity?
4. How should we approach it?
5. What else do we need to know to make a great proposal?

## Steps to take

1. A member of the team from Convivio or a partner should work through all the information the client has provided to us \(in writing and verbally\).

2. They should then write up a [New Opportunity Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_10cfMeMU-NlqYnKUjdjs5lmgfe3qBCEFwosYkQID5s/edit#heading=h.ehi1utb0s9ar) _\(that's the template version, but there'll be a copy in the root of the google drive folder for this opportunity ready for you to edit\)_. We put the information into this standard format so that \(a\) it's easy for other team members to quickly read up on the important things; \(b\) it makes us think about the right stuff; and \(c\) we can see if there are any important gaps in the information provided.

3. Have another member of the team review this document and challenge it. What's missing? What isn't clear? Update it.
4. Have two team-members work through the [New Opportunity Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15SuupWAB1X8Ge4QNfjpEDoF2jvUWfMkkikmkHbRsnZg/edit#gid=0) _\(that's the template version, but there'll be a copy in the root of the google drive folder for this opportunity ready for you to edit\)._
5. Decide whether to pursue this opportunity. The score from the evaluation is only a starter for conversation. Have that discussion and make a decision. Don't be afraid to say no, as we are specialists and not everything will be a good fit.
6. Plan in the time for the right team to work on the proposal. Book it out on the [Float schedule](https://convivio.float.com/) _\(internal link\)_.
7. Go back to the client with any questions that have arisen. Update the New Opportunity Brief as necessary.
8. Do any extra learning and thinking that has been identified.

## Learning and Thinking before Proposing

We'll get to developing our proposal soon, but first we want to learn enough about the client and their problems; the users and their needs; the priorities; the risks; the obstacles and constraints; and so on.

* Review the New Opportunity Brief, and look for areas we need to do more research and thinking on.

* Do we know enough about the client and their current services? Try them out if possible.

* Do we know enough about their market? Get researching.

* Look at the gap between what the client is asking for or expecting, and what we think we should propose. What credible reasoning and supporting evidence can we provide to bridge that gap?

* Look at the _'key questions the client will need a positive answer to before being sure that there is a match'_. What evidence can we provide to answer these?

* What are the risks\/obstacles\/constraints? How will we address these?

* How would we prioritise what needs to be done?




Once we've decided to proceed, and we have done the initial learning and thinking, it's time to develop our proposal.
