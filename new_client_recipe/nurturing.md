# Nurturing

Once we have established a [Connection](/new_client_recipe/connecting.md) with key contact people at a potential client, we want to nurture those relationships.

Just like with romantic relationships this works best when — as long as it's a balanced and respectful relationship —we focus on what we **put in**, rather than what we get out. Remember, we're not trying to sell here, we're trying to find a good match between client needs and our expertise and services. This is the time to share our knowledge and experience in order to demonstrate it, and to show the way we work
